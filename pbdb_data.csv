However, several workers noticed the similarity of Kota fishes with the European Toarcian fishes (Schaeffer and Patterson 1984). Patterson and Owen (1991) suggested that the major marine transgression during the Toarcian might have been instrumental for the invasion of the European Liassic fishes in the circumtethyean continents including parts of Indian subcontinent. Recovery of Darwinula, an early Middle Jurassic ostracod, led Govindan (1975) to suggest a Middle Jurassic age for the Kota Formation. Analysing the faunas of the underlying Dharmaram Formation and of the lower and upper units of the Kota Formation and comparing them with faunas from coeval horizons, Bandyopadhyay and Roychowdhury (1996) and Bandyopadhyay and Sengupta (2006) suggested that the Lower Kota Formation has an age ranging from Sinemurian to Pliensbachian, while the age of the upper Kota is Toarcian and may even be extended to Middle Jurassic (?Aalenian).""

Most of the bones lie at the bottom of this unit, whereas the fossil plants are distributed throughout the bed. This unit is underlain by beds of red, purple, and green-hued carbonate, mudstone, fine sandstone, and siltstone. The base of the fossil-bearing unit is incised into the underlying carbonate unit, or even into the oxidized, muddy siltstone beneath the carbonate unit. Bones are often incorporated within lenses of conglomerate consisting of subrounded to rounded carbonate pebbles. Kirkland and Carpenter (1994) interpreted the carbonate pebbles to be transported calcareous soil nodules, but they may be rip-up clasts from the carbonate unit that underlies the fossil bearing unit in some areas.\r\n The fossiliferous unit is overlain by a bed of resistant, fine-grained volcanic tuff which is well cemented and tends to break perpendicular to the bedding. It was from this tuff that one nearly complete articulated fish, and parts of several others, were recovered (see Kirkland, this volume).\r\nThe presence of a laterally continuous carbonate bed below the quarry, and two laterally continuous tuff units above, indicates that the tuffs were deposited in a predominantly lacustrine environment. Based on the lateral extent of the tuffs, it is estimated that the lake was at least 1.5 km wide. The occurrence of articulated fish in the lower tuff unit indicates deposition in quiet water, although the presence of ripple marks suggest that the water was relatively shallow at times. The fact that fossil root casts are present in the tuff to the southwest and east of Rabbit Valley, but absent in the area of the quarry, implies that the lake level receded temporarily, although water remained in the area of the quarry. The disconformable base of the fossiliferous unit which contains lenses of carbonate pebbles and bone, suggests evidence for temporary fluvial conditions when the unit was first being deposited.","mudstone","gray,green","lithified","silty,conglomeratic","Y","conglomerate","pebbly","lithified","calcareous","Y","pond","","","macrofossils,microfossils","","","","","tooth marks","","","body,cast,adpression,trace,soft parts,permineralized,original carbon,original sporopollenin,replaced with silica","good","allochthonous","time-averaged","concentrate","concentrated","random","","","","frequent","","They feel the ringed wood was transported from a more distant upland while the ringless wood represents a more local flora.

The Salenia texana Zone and Corbula bed fall within the mammillatum zone. The benthic foraminifera Orbitolina texana also suggests a late aptian - early albian age and is found in basal levels and in the upper member (Stricklin et al. 1971). Scott et al.

Paleobotanical analyses on the megaflora and pollen indicates that the Ojo Alamo Sandstone is earliest Paleocene in age and is correlated with palynostratigraphic zones P1 or P2 ( Anderson, 1959; Nichols, 2003; Williamson et al., 2008; Flynn and Peppe, in press). Recent detrital sanidine and paleomagnetic work has constrained the Naashoibito Member to the latest Maastrichtian indicating the K/Pg boundary is represented by the unconformity between the Naashoibito Member and the Ojo Alamo Sandstone (Peppe et al., 2013; Flynn et al., 2019). These data, coupled with previous sedimentological analyses, demonstrate that the Naashoibito Member is late Maastrichtian in age and the Ojo Alamo Sandstone is early Paleocene in age with an erosive unconformity, that cuts out the Cretaceous-Paleogene boundary, separating the two units","","not reported","","","","","","","","","","terrestrial indet.","","","mesofossils","","","","","","","","body","","","","","concentrated","","","","occasional","","","","biostratigraphic","bulk,sieve,field collection","NMMNH","","","","","","","","marine","","actively mobile","volant","","piscivore","","","active flyers (Padian 1983) and mostly piscivorous (Wang and Zhou 2006)","phosphatic","","","","2006-03-08 14:07:19","2014-04-16 10:12:41"

(2021) dated an ash bed just above the Yixian/Jiufotang formation boundary to 122.0 ± 0.9 Ma and three tuff beds from the Xiaotaizi section  to 118.9 ± 0.8 Ma, 118.8 ± 0.6 Ma, and 118.6 ± 1.1 Ma. These ages suggest that the Jiufotang Formation in Jianchang Basin was deposited at ca. 122.0–118.9 Ma.\r\nOlierrok et al. (2019) used a selection of U-Pb and 40Ar-39Ar geochronology to place the Barremian–Aptian boundary (the base of the Chron M0r) between 123.8 and 121.8 Ma. The GTS 2020 uses an age of 121.4 Ma for the base of the Aptian, and multiproxy orbital tuning gives an age of 120.2 Ma for the Barremian-Aptian boundary (Leandro et al., 2022). Therefore, the Yixian Formation should be entirely Late Barremian, with the Jiufotang Formation deposited in the Early Aptian (or latest Barremian at its base).","from a ""tuffaceous"" horizon: lithified based on matrix surrounding figured specimen (pterosaur)","""shale""","tuffaceous","","","Y","mudstone","","","","","lacustrine indet.","","","macrofossils","","","","","","","","body,adpression","excellent","parautochthonous","","","","","","","occasional","","","","taxonomic","surface (in situ),mechanical,field collection,survey of museum collection","IVPP","","","","","1999-2004","pterosaur was ""collected in 1999 by a local farmer and then directly acquired by the NGMC""","","marine","","actively mobile","volant","","piscivore","","","","phosphatic","","","","2006-11-27 11:30:17","2009-08-21 08:52:51"

On the southern margin of the Junggar Basin, Cretaceous outcrops extend in a narrow zone along the northern edge of the Tian Shan fold belt. The Lower Cretaceous is represented there by the Tugulu Group, a thick succession of fluvio-lacustrine beds, which is divided into several formations (probably ranging in age from Neocomian to Albian; see Shen & Mateer, 1992).

Immediately below the specimen, the sediment shows conspicuous bioturbation. The sediment encasing the pterosaur is a dark grey limestone. The sedimentary unit (12 cm thick) including the fossil can be divided into three main parts (Fig. 4): 1) Basal most part (3 cm thick): a micritic limestone with less fossil shells than seen elsewhere; the base is erosional with scour-and-fill-structures; 2) Middle part (5 cm): the matrix is micritic and contains many ooids, and shells (mostly convex side up) and shell fragments; lamellibranchs with both shells preserved are rare; the ooids often have fragments of bivalves and gastropods as nuclei; towards the upper part the\r\nooids show a decrease in grain size, indicating a small scale fining upward sequence; 3) Upper part (4 cm): this micritic part is the matrix of the pterosaur, it shows marly laminated intercalations; the ooid content decreases gradually, they are missing in the uppermost part; the last part of the slab is built up by laminated, yellow, calcareous marl; the latter yields thin shell\r\nfragments and rare ganoid scales.

The layer including the pterosaur is interpreted as a storm deposit, a tempestite that was subsequently bioturbated (presence of Thalassinoides). The increased marl content, the complete absence of ooids in the uppermost part and the clay layer indicate laminar, non-turbulent lower energy conditions.

""middle part"" of formation.\r\nThe Yixian Formation can be subdivided into five units, in ascending order, Lujiatun unit, Lower Lava, Jianshangou unit, Upper Lava, Dawangzhangzi unit, Jingangshan unit, and Huanghuashan unit. Most of the Jehol fossils from the Yixian Formation are preserved in four beds, that is, the Lujiatun bed (recalculated age is 124.0 ± 1.0/1.3 Ma, He et al., 2006), the Jianshangou bed (125.43 ± 0.50/0.88 Ma, Swisher et al., 1999), the Dawangzhangzi bed, and Jinggangshan bed (~122 Ma, Smith et al., 1995).U-Pb dating suggests that the Huangbanjigou section ranges from 124.9 ± 1.7 Ma to 122.8 ± 1.6 Ma (Yang et al., 2007). Chang et al. (2017) obtained Ar/Ar ages of 125.8 ± 1.0 Ma and 126.0 ± 0.8 Ma from the Lujiatun Unit, the lowest part of the Yixian Formation, below the lacustrine shales.\r\nHe et al. (2004) reported a 40Ar/39Ar age of 120.3 ± 0.7 Ma for a tuff layer in the lower part of the Jiufotang Formation, and Chang et al. (2009) obtained a 40Ar/39Ar age of 122.1 ± 0.3 Ma for a tuff layer from the lowermost part of the Jiufotang Formation. Yu et al. (2021) dated an ash bed just above the Yixian/Jiufotang formation boundary to 122.0 ± 0.9 Ma and three tuff beds from the Xiaotaizi section  to 118.9 ± 0.8 Ma, 118.8 ± 0.6 Ma, and 118.6 ± 1.1 Ma. These ages suggest that the Jiufotang Formation in Jianchang Basin was deposited at ca. 122.0–118.9 Ma.\r\nOlierrok et al. (2019) used a selection of U-Pb and 40Ar-39Ar geochronology to place the Barremian–Aptian boundary (the base of the Chron M0r) between 123.8 and 121.8 Ma. The GTS 2020 uses an age of 121.4 Ma for the base of the Aptian, and multiproxy orbital tuning gives an age of 120.2 Ma for the Barremian-Aptian boundary (Leandro et al., 2022). Therefore, the Yixian Formation should be entirely Late Barremian, with the Jiufotang Formation deposited in the Early Aptian (or latest Barremian at its base).","from a ""tuffaceous"" horizon: lithified based on matrix surrounding figured specimen (pterosaur)","""shale""","tuffaceous","","","Y","mudstone","","","","","lacustrine indet.","","","macrofossils","","","","","","","","body,adpression","excellent","parautochthonous","","","","","","","occasional","","","","taxonomic","surface (in situ),mechanical,field collection,survey of museum collection","IVPP","","","","","1999-2004","pterosaur was ""collected in 1999 by a local farmer and then directly acquired by the NGMC""","","marine","","actively mobile","volant","","piscivore","","","","phosphatic","","","","2009-09-10 20:18:17","2009-12-07 09:27:20"

Skeletons are embedded laterally, sometimes in dorsoventral position. Many skeletons of our collection are fully articulated, and disarticulated skeletal elements of fishes and other vertebrates appear to be a result of decay during post-mortem floating. At present there is no evidence for major current transport on the sea floor. Most vertebrate fossils are compressed, as a consequence of the compaction of the sediment. Some specimens are preserved in 3D, although flattened. In several of these specimens, geopetal collapse is observed. In general, compressed specimens are embedded parallel to the lamination. Delicate morphological elements (e.g., fin rays, gill rakers and filaments) of some specimens are obliquely embedded, indicating that the sediment must have been soft. According to microprobe analysis, bones are frequently preserved as fluorapatite. Phosphatization of soft parts such as intestinal contents, myotomes, gill laments, cycloid scales and ns of shes, is observed occasionally and indicates that replacement of organic tissues by uorapatite occurred at a very early stage of diagenetic mineralization, preceding or accompanying microbial decay, and often prior to sediment compaction. This process of a very early and almost instantaneous phosphatization has been described as a medusa effect by Martill (1993a).""\r\n\r\nInvertebrates: Ammonoids are preserved as compressed internal moulds. Most are embedded laterally in the sediment, but occasional diagonally or vertically embedded specimens also occur and suggest the presence of soft or soupy sediment. Aptychi are mostly found isolated; in rare cases, they still rest in the living chamber. Our collection also includes specimens with a phosphatic preservation of the sipho, either complete or with different degrees of fragmentation. Most inoceramids still preserve their thick prismatic shells, although the aragonitic layer is always recrystallized. In a few specimens, the shell is replaced by goethite indicating very early diagenetic replacement of the periostracum by pyrite. Most inoceramid shells are closed, although separated valves, fragmented shells, or rarely shell hash also occur. Calcitic shells such as oysters, ammonoid aptychi, or foraminiferal tests, are preserved with minor recrystallization. Phosphatization of the invertebrate fossils has been recognized in rare occasions, for instance in decapod crustacean carapaces or ammonite siphos."" \r\n\r\n ","general faunal/floral","","","","","","","","","Stramentum barnacle actually from Carranza, according to Ifrim et al., 2011","marine","","actively mobile","volant","","piscivore","","","","phosphatic","","","","2009-11-05 05:40:11","2009-11-05 07:40:11"

Most of the Jehol fossils from the Yixian Formation are preserved in four beds, that is, the Lujiatun bed (recalculated age is 124.0 ± 1.0/1.3 Ma, He et al., 2006), the Jianshangou bed (125.43 ± 0.50/0.88 Ma, Swisher et al., 1999), the Dawangzhangzi bed, and Jinggangshan bed (~122 Ma, Smith et al., 1995).U-Pb dating suggests that the Huangbanjigou section ranges from 124.9 ± 1.7 Ma to 122.8 ± 1.6 Ma (Yang et al., 2007). Chang et al. (2017) obtained Ar/Ar ages of 125.8 ± 1.0 Ma and 126.0 ± 0.8 Ma from the Lujiatun Unit, the lowest part of the Yixian Formation, below the lacustrine shales.\r\nHe et al. (2004) reported a 40Ar/39Ar age of 120.3 ± 0.7 Ma for a tuff layer in the lower part of the Jiufotang Formation, and Chang et al. (2009) obtained a 40Ar/39Ar age of 122.1 ± 0.3 Ma for a tuff layer from the lowermost part of the Jiufotang Formation. Yu et al. (2021) dated an ash bed just above the Yixian/Jiufotang formation boundary to 122.0 ± 0.9 Ma and three tuff beds from the Xiaotaizi section  to 118.9 ± 0.8 Ma, 118.8 ± 0.6 Ma, and 118.6 ± 1.1 Ma. These ages suggest that the Jiufotang Formation in Jianchang Basin was deposited at ca. 122.0–118.9 Ma.\r\nOlierrok et al. (2019) used a selection of U-Pb and 40Ar-39Ar geochronology to place the Barremian–Aptian boundary (the base of the Chron M0r) between 123.8 and 121.8 Ma. The GTS 2020 uses an age of 121.4 Ma for the base of the Aptian, and multiproxy orbital tuning gives an age of 120.2 Ma for the Barremian-Aptian boundary (Leandro et al., 2022). Therefore, the Yixian Formation should be entirely Late Barremian, with the Jiufotang Formation deposited in the Early Aptian (or latest Barremian at its base).","","not reported","","","","","","","","","","lacustrine indet.","","","macrofossils","some","","","","","","","body,adpression,soft parts","good","parautochthonous","time-averaged","","","","","","","","","","taxonomic","","IVPP","","","","","","","","marine","","actively mobile","volant","","piscivore","","","","phosphatic","","","","2009-12-07 05:19:37","2009-12-07 07:19:37"

Zeiss 1977), and thus of an assumed Early Tithonian age (Rueppellianus Zone, Riedense or Early Rueppellianus Subzone) (G. Schweigert, personal communication 2011). On the other hand, if it came from the Kelheim area, then it is either from the lithostratigraphic equivalent of the uppermost Kimmeridgian of the Kapfelberg locality, or from the Lower Tithonian plattenkalks of the Goldberg locality (cf. Röper 2005a; Schweigert 2007). Since Kapfelberg has delivered a great quantity of reptile finds, it is the more probable locality (cf. Abel 1922; Kemp 2001).

Most of the Jehol fossils from the Yixian Formation are preserved in four beds, that is, the Lujiatun bed (recalculated age is 124.0 ± 1.0/1.3 Ma, He et al., 2006), the Jianshangou bed (125.43 ± 0.50/0.88 Ma, Swisher et al., 1999), the Dawangzhangzi bed, and Jinggangshan bed (~122 Ma, Smith et al., 1995).U-Pb dating suggests that the Huangbanjigou section ranges from 124.9 ± 1.7 Ma to 122.8 ± 1.6 Ma (Yang et al., 2007). Chang et al. (2017) obtained Ar/Ar ages of 125.8 ± 1.0 Ma and 126.0 ± 0.8 Ma from the Lujiatun Unit, the lowest part of the Yixian Formation, below the lacustrine shales.\r\nHe et al. (2004) reported a 40Ar/39Ar age of 120.3 ± 0.7 Ma for a tuff layer in the lower part of the Jiufotang Formation, and Chang et al. (2009) obtained a 40Ar/39Ar age of 122.1 ± 0.3 Ma for a tuff layer from the lowermost part of the Jiufotang Formation. Yu et al. (2021) dated an ash bed just above the Yixian/Jiufotang formation boundary to 122.0 ± 0.9 Ma and three tuff beds from the Xiaotaizi section  to 118.9 ± 0.8 Ma, 118.8 ± 0.6 Ma, and 118.6 ± 1.1 Ma. These ages suggest that the Jiufotang Formation in Jianchang Basin was deposited at ca. 122.0–118.9 Ma.\r\nOlierrok et al. (2019) used a selection of U-Pb and 40Ar-39Ar geochronology to place the Barremian–Aptian boundary (the base of the Chron M0r) between 123.8 and 121.8 Ma. The GTS 2020 uses an age of 121.4 Ma for the base of the Aptian, and multiproxy orbital tuning gives an age of 120.2 Ma for the Barremian-Aptian boundary (Leandro et al., 2022). Therefore, the Yixian Formation should be entirely Late Barremian, with the Jiufotang Formation deposited in the Early Aptian (or latest Barremian at its base).","""shales rich in volcanic ash""","""shale""","bentonitic","","","Y","","","","","","lacustrine indet.","","","macrofossils","","some","","partial skeletons","","","","body,adpression","good","","snapshot","","","","","","occasional","","","","taxonomic","selective quarrying,mechanical,survey of museum collection","","","","","","2002","LPM: Liaoning Paleontological Museum, Shenyang Normal University","","marine","","actively mobile","volant","","piscivore","","","","phosphatic","","","","2010-03-08 04:46:41","2010-03-08 06:46:41"

Most of the Jehol fossils from the Yixian Formation are preserved in four beds, that is, the Lujiatun bed (recalculated age is 124.0 ± 1.0/1.3 Ma, He et al., 2006), the Jianshangou bed (125.43 ± 0.50/0.88 Ma, Swisher et al., 1999), the Dawangzhangzi bed, and Jinggangshan bed (~122 Ma, Smith et al., 1995).U-Pb dating suggests that the Huangbanjigou section ranges from 124.9 ± 1.7 Ma to 122.8 ± 1.6 Ma (Yang et al., 2007). Chang et al. (2017) obtained Ar/Ar ages of 125.8 ± 1.0 Ma and 126.0 ± 0.8 Ma from the Lujiatun Unit, the lowest part of the Yixian Formation, below the lacustrine shales.\r\nHe et al. (2004) reported a 40Ar/39Ar age of 120.3 ± 0.7 Ma for a tuff layer in the lower part of the Jiufotang Formation, and Chang et al. (2009) obtained a 40Ar/39Ar age of 122.1 ± 0.3 Ma for a tuff layer from the lowermost part of the Jiufotang Formation. Yu et al. (2021) dated an ash bed just above the Yixian/Jiufotang formation boundary to 122.0 ± 0.9 Ma and three tuff beds from the Xiaotaizi section  to 118.9 ± 0.8 Ma, 118.8 ± 0.6 Ma, and 118.6 ± 1.1 Ma. These ages suggest that the Jiufotang Formation in Jianchang Basin was deposited at ca. 122.0–118.9 Ma.\r\nOlierrok et al. (2019) used a selection of U-Pb and 40Ar-39Ar geochronology to place the Barremian–Aptian boundary (the base of the Chron M0r) between 123.8 and 121.8 Ma. The GTS 2020 uses an age of 121.4 Ma for the base of the Aptian, and multiproxy orbital tuning gives an age of 120.2 Ma for the Barremian-Aptian boundary (Leandro et al., 2022). Therefore, the Yixian Formation should be entirely Late Barremian, with the Jiufotang Formation deposited in the Early Aptian (or latest Barremian at its base).","","""shale""","","","","","mudstone","","","","","lacustrine indet.","","","macrofossils","some","","","skeletons","","","","body,adpression","good","parautochthonous","snapshot","conservation","","","","","none","","","","taxonomic","","","","","","","","GLGMV: Guilin Longshan Geological Museum, Guilin","","marine","","actively mobile","volant","","piscivore","","","","phosphatic","","","","2010-03-26 08:45:19","2014-03-01 10:10:03"

Pre-Coniacian reports (Londeix et al., 1996; Zippi, personal commun., 2009) of both D. acuminatum and D. euclaense initially suggested a likely Turonian age for SMU 76476, but the fissile, dark gray shales of the Turonian Eagle Ford Group north of Dallas are inconsistent with the matrix lithology. The limestone matrix surrounding SMU 76476 is consistent with the chalk deposits of the lower part of the Austin Group (Fig. 1), so T. salpinx and C. spinosa are interpreted as reworked from the underlying Eagle Ford Group.

Miller's localities were re-discovered by the Geological Survey, and a few vertebrate fossils were collected which add little to Miller's collection. The Reptile Bed was referred to the Lower Shales of Barrow's local succession in the Great Estuarine Series. Lists of invertebrate fossils from the Reptile Bed and associated beds were given for the first time; they were referred to as from the 'reptile bed', the 'fish bed', etc. but no measured section was given to identify the sequence of these named beds (Barrow 1908). Hudson (1962a) published a general account of the stratigraphy of the Great Estuarine Series which showed that its age is Upper Bajocian and Bathonian. Barrow's Lower Shales were shown to be the equivalents of the Estheria Shales of Skye.

Skeletons are embedded laterally, sometimes in dorsoventral position. Many skeletons of our collection are fully articulated, and disarticulated skeletal elements of fishes and other vertebrates appear to be a result of decay during post-mortem floating. At present there is no evidence for major current transport on the sea floor. Most vertebrate fossils are compressed, as a consequence of the compaction of the sediment. Some specimens are preserved in 3D, although flattened. In several of these specimens, geopetal collapse is observed. In general, compressed specimens are embedded parallel to the lamination. Delicate morphological elements (e.g., fin rays, gill rakers and filaments) of some specimens are obliquely embedded, indicating that the sediment must have been soft. According to microprobe analysis, bones are frequently preserved as fluorapatite. Phosphatization of soft parts such as intestinal contents, myotomes, gill laments, cycloid scales and ns of shes, is observed occasionally and indicates that replacement of organic tissues by uorapatite occurred at a very early stage of diagenetic mineralization, preceding or accompanying microbial decay, and often prior to sediment compaction. This process of a very early and almost instantaneous phosphatization has been described as a medusa effect by Martill (1993a).""\r\n\r\nInvertebrates: Ammonoids are preserved as compressed internal moulds. Most are embedded laterally in the sediment, but occasional diagonally or vertically embedded specimens also occur and suggest the presence of soft or soupy sediment. Aptychi are mostly found isolated; in rare cases, they still rest in the living chamber. Our collection also includes specimens with a phosphatic preservation of the sipho, either complete or with different degrees of fragmentation. Most inoceramids still preserve their thick prismatic shells, although the aragonitic layer is always recrystallized. In a few specimens, the shell is replaced by goethite indicating very early diagenetic replacement of the periostracum by pyrite. Most inoceramid shells are closed, although separated valves, fragmented shells, or rarely shell hash also occur. Calcitic shells such as oysters, ammonoid aptychi, or foraminiferal tests, are preserved with minor recrystallization. Phosphatization of the invertebrate fossils has been recognized in rare occasions, for instance in decapod crustacean carapaces or ammonite siphos."" \r\n\r\n ","general faunal/floral","","","","","","","","","Stramentum barnacle actually from Carranza, according to Ifrim et al., 2011","marine","","actively mobile","volant","","piscivore","","","","phosphatic","","","","2012-11-09 19:30:34","2012-11-09 02:30:34"

The SMNK was initially told that the pterosaur originated from a quarry at Hâqel, although doubts were raised during discussions with another local dealer. We were later informed that this fossil had probably not been removed from the quarry of Hâqel but was likely from the nearby locality of Hjoûla (Roy Nohra, personal communication). As Hjoûla is only ~4 km south of Hâqel it is conceivable that the fossil dealers and middle men were uncertain as to the specimen’s exact provenance. The sediments of Hâqel, however, contain a moderate amount of bioclasts and are noticeably whiter in colouration than those of Hjoûla, which are more micritic. A comparison of the grey limestone slab with other specimens housed at the SMNK leads us to propose the Early Cenomanian locality of Hjoûla as the true provenance of this specimen.

One of the authors (JL) later visited the fossil locality, guided by the farmer. Because the specimen was not excavated by a technically accomplished collector, it was heavily damaged during excavation. During the visit to the site, JL and the collector found a fragment of black bone from a pterosaur, which is identical to the present specimen in color. Thus, we are confident that the locality the farmer pinpointed is the locality where the specimen described here was collected. The specimen comes from gray-green tuffaceous shales (Fig. 2), which based on lithology are most likely belonging to the second member of the Upper Jurassic Tuchengzi Formation (Bureau of Geology and Mineral Resources of Liaoning Province, 1989).\r\n\r\nHenan Geological Museum, Zhengzhou, Henan Province.","","marine","","actively mobile","volant","","piscivore","","","","phosphatic","","","","2015-01-19 08:10:38","2015-01-19 08:10:38"

(2013), approximately 10 m above the basal conglomeratic sandstone. Stratigraphically, Phu Noi is approximately 500 m below all the localities that yielded the large Basilochelys turtles (Kham Phok, Dan Luang, Huai Sai and Dan Kaeng; Tong et al. 2009a); the four sites mentioned above are situated closer to the boundary with the overlying Phra Wihan Formation (Cuny et al. 2013). The age of the Phu Kradung Formation is still debated. The studies on dinosaur remains suggested a Late Jurassic age (Buffetaut, Suteethorn & Tong, 2006; Buffetaut & Suteethorn, 2007), while the recent studies on palynology supported a basal Cretaceous age for that formation, although a latest Jurassic age cannot be ruled out for its lowermost part (Racey & Goodall, 2009).","A series of siltstones and mudstones of the palaeochannel, referred to as PNB.

Most of the Jehol fossils from the Yixian Formation are preserved in four beds, that is, the Lujiatun bed (recalculated age is 124.0 ± 1.0/1.3 Ma, He et al., 2006), the Jianshangou bed (125.43 ± 0.50/0.88 Ma, Swisher et al., 1999), the Dawangzhangzi bed, and Jinggangshan bed (~122 Ma, Smith et al., 1995).U-Pb dating suggests that the Huangbanjigou section ranges from 124.9 ± 1.7 Ma to 122.8 ± 1.6 Ma (Yang et al., 2007). Chang et al. (2017) obtained Ar/Ar ages of 125.8 ± 1.0 Ma and 126.0 ± 0.8 Ma from the Lujiatun Unit, the lowest part of the Yixian Formation, below the lacustrine shales.\r\nHe et al. (2004) reported a 40Ar/39Ar age of 120.3 ± 0.7 Ma for a tuff layer in the lower part of the Jiufotang Formation, and Chang et al. (2009) obtained a 40Ar/39Ar age of 122.1 ± 0.3 Ma for a tuff layer from the lowermost part of the Jiufotang Formation. Yu et al. (2021) dated an ash bed just above the Yixian/Jiufotang formation boundary to 122.0 ± 0.9 Ma and three tuff beds from the Xiaotaizi section  to 118.9 ± 0.8 Ma, 118.8 ± 0.6 Ma, and 118.6 ± 1.1 Ma. These ages suggest that the Jiufotang Formation in Jianchang Basin was deposited at ca. 122.0–118.9 Ma.\r\nOlierrok et al. (2019) used a selection of U-Pb and 40Ar-39Ar geochronology to place the Barremian–Aptian boundary (the base of the Chron M0r) between 123.8 and 121.8 Ma. The GTS 2020 uses an age of 121.4 Ma for the base of the Aptian, and multiproxy orbital tuning gives an age of 120.2 Ma for the Barremian-Aptian boundary (Leandro et al., 2022). Therefore, the Yixian Formation should be entirely Late Barremian, with the Jiufotang Formation deposited in the Early Aptian (or latest Barremian at its base).","","not reported","","","","","","","","","","terrestrial indet.","","","macrofossils","","","","","","","","body,adpression","excellent","autochthonous","snapshot","","","life position","","","","","","","taxonomic","selective quarrying,surface (in situ),mechanical,field collection","IVPP","","","","","1998","","","marine","","actively mobile","volant","","piscivore","","","","phosphatic","","","","2015-06-25 13:12:25","2015-06-25 13:12:25"

The locality of Brunn is situated at the southern rim of one of the smallest of these depressions, the Pfraundorf-Heitzenhofener Basin. \r\n... the rarity of the fully marine chondrichthyans supports the interpretation of Brunn as a rather isolated, marginal marine, probably lagoonal environment (Röper & Rothgaenger 1997; Heyng et al. 2015).

Together with the neighbouring Eromanga Basin, these form the majority of the present day Great Artesian Basin (GAB). The Griman Creek Formation is composed of thinly laminated and interbedded fine- to medium-grained sandstones, siltstones and mudstones, with carbonate cements, intraformational conglomerate beds and coal deposits (Burger, 1980; Green et al., 1997). Within the Griman Creek Formation, opal and fossils occur within interbedded siltstone and mudstone layers, often referred to as the Finch clay facies (Byrnes, 1977). Palynological evidence indicates that the Griman Creek Formation is associated with the Coptospora paradoxa Zone and correlates to the middle Albian (Burger, 1980). Apatite fission-track analyses on grains derived from core samples of the Queensland extent of the Griman Creek Formation indicate an upper age boundary of approximately 107 Mya (Raza, Hill & Korsch, 2009).","""mixed carbonate-siliciclastic""","","lithified","","","","","","","","""floodplain""","","","macrofossils,mesofossils","","","","","","","","body","","parautochthonous","","","","","","","","","","","general faunal/floral","selective quarrying,field collection","","","","","T.

An early Cenomanian age for deposition of the Cambridge Greensand is based on an apparently autochthonous foraminiferan assemblage, but Morter and Wood (1983) could not rule out the possibility of a very late Albian age due to the presence of the bivalve Aucinella.

The SMNK was initially told that the pterosaur originated from a quarry at Hâqel, although doubts were raised during discussions with another local dealer. We were later informed that this fossil had probably not been removed from the quarry of Hâqel but was likely from the nearby locality of Hjoûla (Roy Nohra, personal communication). As Hjoûla is only ~4 km south of Hâqel it is conceivable that the fossil dealers and middle men were uncertain as to the specimen’s exact provenance. The sediments of Hâqel, however, contain a moderate amount of bioclasts and are noticeably whiter in colouration than those of Hjoûla, which are more micritic. A comparison of the grey limestone slab with other specimens housed at the SMNK leads us to propose the Early Cenomanian locality of Hjoûla as the true provenance of this specimen. This conclusion could be further confirmed by a thin section or petrographic analysis, but these were beyond the scope of this investigation.","gplates","503","mid","41.38","15.33","scotese","508","mid","29.99","12.79","seton","503","mid","34.50","15.69","LB","","Sannine Limestone","","","group of beds","","","","","","","","","","Hjoûla Lagerstätte of the Sannine Limestone","","mudstone","gray","","calcareous","Y","","","","","","carbonate indet.","","During the Cretaceous Period the majority of the sediments were deposited within the Palmyride Basin, a large NNE–SSW trending intraplate trough, which persisted until the end of the Cretaceous when it was destroyed by regional compression. Within this basin the sediments slope westwards to form a single large monoclinal structure and the depositional environments are split between a western, open marine facies and an eastern, coastal facies (Nader et al. 2006).\r\nSaint-Marc (1974) described the palaeoenvironments of both Hâqel and Hjoûla during the Cenomanian as a small, oxygen depleted, marine basin, with the major land mass being located in the present WSW portion of the Arabian Peninsula. Nader et al. (2006) later described the depositional environment in the frame of a carbonate ramp model with shallower waters prevailing to the far east of Lebanon.","macrofossils","","some","","","","","","body,soft parts","","","","conservation","","","","","","","","","taxonomic","survey of museum collection","","","","","","","SMNK, Staatliches Museum für Naturkunde Karlsruhe (Germany), obtained from a fossil dealer","","marine","","actively mobile","volant","","piscivore","","","","phosphatic","","","","2019-12-19 08:36:55","2019-12-19 08:36:55"

This extensive area of fossil digging is centred around 31°36’55.87”N – 4°15’42.67” W. A second important area of fossil digging, and lying slightly closer to the Taqrout plateau is within and adjacent to a sandstone quarry at Lamaaka at 31°38’51.13” N – 4°13’41.47” W.

The sediments at the excavation level are mostly fine-grained, and vary from finely laminated clay and silt to redeposited river sediments with some content of sand and gravel. Synsedimentary slides have been recorded as well as mass limestone blocks of up to several meters in size, which broke down from the former cave walls during sedimentation.

Many of the troughs in the basal few metres of the unit are scoured and infilled with, or floored by matrix-supported conglomerate, variably comprising medium to coarse sand grains, ‘grit’ (very coarse sand to small pebble size quartz and feldspar) with mica flakes, rounded mudstone rip-up clasts (typically up to 10 cm, and rarer clasts up to 25 cm), compacted, coalified/carbonized, river transported tree limbs/branches and logs (up to 1 m diameter and some up to 5 m in length) and tree stumps with root bases and attached soil (Fig. 3). The trough cross-beds pass up into climbing rippled beds of medium to fine-grained sandstone and interbedded, very fine-grained sandstone and siltstone layers at the unit top.
